This is a Dimagi RapidSMS project for deployment of a Circumcision follow-up
reminder system in Kenya.  

When development settles down a bit, the rapidsms package can be bundled into
a deb, rpm, .tar.gz (or whatever), and installed into site-packages. For now,
it is a submodule.

Setup
=====

1) To retrieve the rapidsms submodule, run:

git submodule init
git submodule update

from the top level of the tree (i.e., this directory).

2) The RapidSMS repo also contains submodules of its own, so cd to the top
level of the rapidsms tree and run init and update there as well:

cd submodules/rapidsms
git submodule init
git submodule update

3) To create your database and tables, run:

./manage.py syncdb

4) To start the Django development server, run:

./manage.py runserver
